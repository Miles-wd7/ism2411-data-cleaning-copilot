1. Copilot took my original script and fixed any small issues with it. I then gave it the functions (def remove_invalid_rows(df):) and (def handle_missing_values(df):) to implement into my script. It then implemented those functions into my script and added or removed any lines necessary to make sure the program runs. It also adjusted my path and made sure certain mistakes or lines in the wrong place were taken care of. 

2. I had to change the logic and questions I was giving copilot because it was not fully understanding what I was asking for. I also had it simplify steps and explain steps to me more carefully so that I knew what I was entering was correct. although after some tries it would not give me the correct script or a line that did not work and I had to work around it and try and see what I did wrong myself. 

3. What I learned about cleaning up code is that I never want to do it again. It seems very easy at first yet as you keep going it just gets more and more complex. I did have fun with this project as I kinda like how many different tools and files I had to use just to clean up the code. What I learned from Copilot is that A.I. still hasn't fully mastered coding and it’s harder to fix mistakes with Copilot than with a teacher or someone who has mastered python.
