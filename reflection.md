This script takes a messy sales dataset, cleans it, and saves a cleaned version for analysis. 
It standardizes column names, removes extra space, converts price and quantity columns to 
numbers, drops rows with missing or invalid data, and filters out any negative quantities or 
prices. Each step is processed by a separate function to keep the code organized and easy to follow. 
When the script is run, it reads the raw CSV from the project’s data folder, cleans all the 
functions in order, and then outputs a new clean CSV file in the processed folder.
